      "descriptionHtml": "<strong>Aim:</strong> We're currently crafting a cutting-edge surface as a key component of our ongoing research endeavor. This innovative surface is meticulously designed to minimize liquid splashes. Leveraging advanced fluid physics simulations, particularly with the support of Ansys Fluent, we've fine-tuned multiple parameters to perfection. Our exploration has led us to utilize top-tier materials like SLA-resin and PDMS, ensuring the utmost effectiveness and durability of the structure.",
