        "details": ["Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture, but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system.[22] Because of the dominance of the Linux-based Android on smartphones, Linux, including Android, has the largest installed base of all general-purpose operating systems, as of May 2022.[23][24][25] Although Linux is, as of May 2022, used by only around 2.3 percent of desktop computers,[26] the Chromebook, which runs the Linux kernel-based Chrome OS, dominates the US Kâ€“12 education market and represents nearly 20 percent of sub-$300 notebook sales in the US.[27] Linux is the leading operating system on servers (over 96.4% of the top 1 million web servers' operating systems are Linux),[28] leads other big iron systems such as mainframe computers, and is the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers (since November 2017, having gradually eliminated all competitors)."],
